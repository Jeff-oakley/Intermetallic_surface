# Dataset of bimetallic and trimetallic intermetallic surfaces

In our work of [Design principle of carbon supported single atom catalyst – interplay between d-band periodicity and local hybridization](to_be_added), we 
developed a computational dataset with 140 catalysts and 560 adsorption energies. Based on such dataset, we have established
 a design principle for understanding the catalytic process M@C<sub>(4-x)</sub>N<sub>x</sub>. For promoting the transparency
of our research, we have open sourced all our DFT data in this Github Repo

## Free energy diagram
The free energy diagram of HER and OER processes have been dumped in `./predicted_performance/FreeEnergy`

## Overpotential map
The map of overpotentials of HER and ORR reactions as being shown in our research paper has been demonstrated in `./predicted_performance/overpotential`

## Interactive dataset
The interactive version of the dataset is available as [HER Free Energy](https://jeff-oakley.github.io/SAC_HOER_data/heatmap_HER.html)
and [ORR Free Energy](https://jeff-oakley.github.io/SAC_HOER_data/heatmap_ORR.html)

## Raw DFT data
The raw DFT data, have been preprared and dumped in `./RawData` folder

#### Input data files:
* `INCAR`: The INCAR we used for DFT relaxation for both substrate and adsorption model.
* `KPOINTS`: The KPOINTS we selected for DFT relaxation.
* `POTCAR_info`: The POTCAR version we used for generating the raw data.
* `CONTCAR`: The final atomic model we obtained after DFT relaxation.
* `OSZICAR`: The energy profile of DFT relaxation.
