# Database of Electronic Structures for Intermetallic Surfaces

In our work of [Charting the Electronic Structure for Discovering Intermetallic Catalysts](Available after publication), we computed electronic structure of 12,057 
intermetallic surface generated from a pool of 2,358 binary and tenary intermetallic hosted in [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/)

## Interactive database
The database is available interactively at [This Link](https://jeff-oakley.github.io/Intermetallic_surface/htmls/IntermallicHeatmap.html). For any inquiry of 
the raw data, feel free to email Prof. Bin Ouyang at [bouyang@fsu.edu](mailto:bouyang@fsu.edu)

## Citing
We offer such dataset for promoting the transparency of research. Whenever our repo can be useful for you,
